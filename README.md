# TDD Katas

This repository is a collection of katas I have solved to practice:
- Problem-solving and incremental development.
- Algorithmic thinking.
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) using Python and pytest.
- Writing clean, PEP8-compliant code.

## Repository Structure

Each kata is organised into its own folder under the `katas/` directory, with the following structure:

```
katas/
├── kata-name/
│   ├── README.md       # Problem description, examples, and edge cases
│   ├── kata.py         # Solution implementation
│   ├── test_kata.py    # Unit tests for the kata
```
